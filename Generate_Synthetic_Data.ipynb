You have told me to take two opposite and different courses of action at once. Please, O KRISHNA, tell me of just one wise solution and course of action that would lead out of this problem safely.\\n\\nThe Blessed Lord replied\\xa0: O Arjuna, always remember in life that there are only two definite paths of action as I have described before. One of these is known as Sankhyayoga or the path of knowledge, and the other is Karmayoga, or the path of performing duty and action without expecting any result.\\n\\nO Arjuna, it is not only important to understand the meanings of Sankhyayoga and Karmayoga, but it is also important to understand the aims or goals behind each of these courses of action.The aim of Karmayoga is to achieve freedom from action. One cannot achieve the goal by total inaction or by not performing any action at all. The goal of Sankhyayoga is the realization of God. When one has fully realized God, he has reached a state of perfection. Once simply cannot attain this state of perfection by giving up or retreating from the performance of one’s actions.'}.\n",

Thus, both Deity and mankind grow continually. they will both achieve their supreme goal.\\n\\nThrough the spirit of sacrifice of Yagya, the Deities grow and progress.
